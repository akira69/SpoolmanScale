// The case it exists for: the spool is on the scale, the user links it in the
// backend's own web UI, and the scale has no way of hearing about it. Without
// this the tag has to be lifted off and put back, which is the scale looking
// broken while everything worked.
//
// Deliberately cheap: only the server side tag lookup each backend already
// has, never the inventory scan that a real miss falls through to. Call from
// the loop.
