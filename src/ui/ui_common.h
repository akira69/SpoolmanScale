//
// What an exhausted pool does was long noted here as while(1) from
// LV_USE_ASSERT_MALLOC - a freeze, no reboot. That is wrong for the case that
// matters: lv_obj_class_create_obj() (lv_obj_class.c:47) returns NULL without
// asserting anything, and lv_obj_create() / lv_label_create() hand that
// straight to lv_obj_class_init_obj(), which writes to obj->layout_inv. So a
// list that outgrows the pool is a null dereference, which on the ESP32 is
// "PANIC (exception/abort)" and on the card is no explanation at all.
// Reproduced in the simulator, see lvPoolHasRoomForRow() below.

// Call it in pairs around a list build, "<name>/pre" and "<name>/post", with
// rows = 0 on the pre call. The cost of one row is then

// It exists because a blocking backend call and a question on screen cannot
// share the loop. lv_timer_handler() is what reads the touch panel, and it
// does not run while an HTTP request is in flight - a full inventory is six
// seconds on a library of 250 - so the question sits there taking no input
// and looks broken. Pumping LVGL from inside the request is not the way out:
// loading_overlay.cpp repaints with lv_refr_now() for exactly this reason and
// says why, dispatching events from there would re-enter the callback the
// request was started from.
//
// So the expensive lookup stands aside instead. The cheap server side tag
// search still runs, and spoolmanRecheckTick() keeps retrying it while an
// unknown tag lies on the pad, which is what makes standing aside free.
